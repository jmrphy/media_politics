<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This module provides a theoretical and empirical overview of the role played by information, communication, and media within the politics of the modern state. Students are introduced to canonical as well as marginal and emerging perspectives on media politics and asked to weigh them against the empirical record established by extant qualitative and quantitative scholarship. You'll quickly notice that the course materials are in a wide variety of media. All of the materials are digital and freely available to you through links within this document.</p>

<p>Each week will be devoted to a theme. Typically, each week’s materials have been curated to expose the student to the dominant theoretical perspective, a dissident or heterodox perspective, and something empirical (qualitative or quantitative) to help fix ideas. The balance of these materials will be variable and depend on the nature of theme.</p>

<h4>
<a name="summary-of-teaching-and-learning-strategies" class="anchor" href="#summary-of-teaching-and-learning-strategies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary of teaching and learning strategies</h4>

<p>Focused, directed readings which students complete before each session will provide the core material around which each session is organized. Each session will include a lecture providing a general overview of the main points which will be followed by discussion questions in response to which students will exercise their command of the material. These teaching and learning methods will achieve the aims and learning outcomes of the module by providing a focused, consistent, and supportive environment where students engage with the material in multiple ways (through reading, audible/visual lectures, and through their own speaking). </p>

<h4>
<a name="aims-and-objectives" class="anchor" href="#aims-and-objectives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aims and objectives</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Students will gain an independent and critical command of the essential questions in media politics. They will learn to engage with historical texts, theoretical texts, contemporary academic research, as well as cutting-edge contemporary discussions of media politics on the internet. In other words, students will acquire the theoretical tools required of any global citizen who would seek to produce new knowledge in the state-of-the-art of media politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Students will be able to apply their knowledge to diverse real-world issues, questions, and historical trends. - Students will improve their ability to develop original research questions and write formal academic research papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Students will develop the oral and verbal skills necessary to communicate their ideas effectively to a wide range of audiences. In particular, through their engagement with contemporary theorists and practitioners of media politics online, students will learn the skills and norms required to become active and networked participants in both theoretical discussions and on-the-ground developments in media politics.</p></li>

<a name="what-students-will-gain-from-this-module" class="anchor" href="#what-students-will-gain-from-this-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What students will gain from this module</h4>

<p>Having successfully completed the module, students will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have a critical, developed, independent perspective on the role of media in the politics across contemporary states.</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to speak, write, and disseminate online their independent perspectives on the main questions and issues in the politics of media.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a basic working knowledge of today’s incipient trends and questions in the politics of media, and their institutional landscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a more reflexive awareness of how the politics of media shape their own perceptions and behaviors.</p></li>

<a name="week-4-practicum-on-media-politics" class="anchor" href="#week-4-practicum-on-media-politics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 4. Practicum on media politics</h5>

<p>The world wide web is celebrated for opening up information and communication, but as we will learn, informational and communicative power on the web is only enjoyed by those who have the resources required to use it. Thus, part of this course is about imparting to you the resources and tools required to even access what is uniquely interesting (and hopefully empowering for you) in the contemporary politics of the media.</p>

<p>All students must have a personal blog, a twitter account, a twitter client, and an RSS reader. Don't freak out: all of these things are free, easy to learn, and will make your life easier and more powerful after just a little bit of investment up front. The first two are becoming absolutely necessary for anyone who wishes to have a voice in the public sphere, and the second two are necessary if one wishes to actually increase one's information and knowledge in a powerful and effective way.</p>

<p>If you don't have a blog and a twitter account, then you basically don't have an independent voice on the web, where vast amounts of information and communication and therefore politics takes place; if you don't have a voice, then you can only be a passive listener at best, which has nothing to do with politics. If you don't have a twitter client and an RSS reader, then you can't control your own media diet and you won't be surfing the net so much as drowning in it. The "information superhighway" does not automatically increase one's information and knowledge flows; on the contrary, the standard, naive internet life of most people probably decreases and deforms daily flows of information and knowledge. (Google and Facebook are driven by algorithms which only give you what you already know and like, and which make sure that your voice is only shared with others who already know and like you, probably limiting and <em>perverting</em> more than enhancing one's flows of information and communication.) Ergo, because you are here to learn about the politics of the media, a blog, twitter account, twitter client, and RSS reader are implicit pre-requisite for even having a chance at learning something about the politics of the media today.</p>

<p><strong>A blog</strong>: Any blogging platform will do, including any blog you might already run. If you've never blogged and you're intimidated then I would recommend using Tumblr, which is very easy to use, stylish, and has a huge community of bloggers. Tumblr blogs tend toward shorter and quicker reads, photos, quotes, etc., and Tumblr in general encourages "reblogging" posts from other Tumblr blogs on your own. If you write more frequently or plan to blog more ambitiously in or after this course, you might want to select a platform that gives you more options and control over your content. Wordpress is perhaps the most popular and powerful platform, although it can be a little confusing and the free version puts ads on your posts. Typepad and Blogger are both perfectly good and commonly used competitors. You might also explore newer blogging platforms which seem to emphasize superior style and community engagement, such as Medium and Svbte. Really up to you.</p>

<p><strong>A twitter account</strong>. Pretty straightforward. Sign up at twitter.com.</p>

<p><strong>A twitter client</strong>. A twitter "client" is just a third-party application for managing and reading twitter feeds. I recommend Tweetdeck, but there are a few other popular ones such as Tweetbot and Hootsuite.</p>

<p><strong>An RSS reader</strong>. "RSS" stands for "Rich Site Summary" or "Really Simple Syndication", and it's just a simple protocol that turns websites into feeds so that readers can subscribe and recieve updates from all of their favorite websites all in one place. That one place is an RSS reader, which is basically just a big self-designed newspaper composed of all the websites you want to follow.</p>
