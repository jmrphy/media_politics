### Overview

The world wide web is celebrated for revolutionizing flows of information and communication, but the power of the web is only enjoyed by those who know how to use it. Thus, **part of this course is about giving you the resources and tools required for you to flourish on the web as free, creative and socially effective young intellectuals.** This document outlines this dimension of the course and explains in detail the tools and practices you'll need to obtain and use. Nothing here costs money and nothing requires very fancy computer skills. Additionally, below you'll find explanations and advice which should make everything as accessible as possible.

**In short, the basic toolkit you need to setup is:**

    - A personal blog
    - A twitter account
    - A twitter client
    - An RSS reader
    
If you don't know what these things are, don't worry! They're all easy to learn and use, and will make your life *easier* and *more powerful* after just a little bit of investment up front. A blog and a twitter account are quickly becoming absolute requirements for anyone who still wishes to have a voice in society; a twitter client and an RSS reader are indispensible for actually learning from the web.

The course itself will be run with these tools. It's simple: Everything you do toward your research for this course, just do it on your blog and your twitter account! Using our twitter clients and RSS feeds, we'll also be following along with everyone else's progress, and you'll be asked to give each other support and feedback in blog comments and twitter replies. As we go, your progress will be tracked and assessed, and at the end your entire web output will be assessed alongside the more specific assessments of the course.

#### A note on anonymity

While you are invited and encouraged to submit everything via your blog, including your longer and more formal assignments, you are also welcome to keep your web presence anonymous if you prefer. Just make your blog and twitter username something unconnected to your real identity (but send me a private email so I know it's you). Anonymous bloggers and tweeters also have an illustrious history! Finally, the course will rely on a back-end system which collects and organizes your content to allow for anonymous grading.

### Details for setup

Below I outline a basic workflow for your new internet-based research life. If you're familiar with all these things already, then you can do these things however you please. But if you're at all unsure, then I *strongly advise* you to just follow my recommendations and step-by-step guide.

##### 1. A web browser (recommending Google Chrome)
If any of this stuff intimidates you, then just start using Google Chrome. That way you can follow my advice very exactly and I can advise you very exactly. If you're familiar with all these things already, then you'll probably be fine using any of the major web browsers. If you can't figure something out on your own, then just set yourself up on Chrome so you can just follow this guide verbatim.**

#### 2. A blog

A blog, short for "weblog," is a simple web site where you post whatever you want and everything is kept organized for you chronologically. There are several free blogging "platforms" which basically do everything for you. For this course, any major blogging platform will do, including any blog you might already run. If you've never blogged and you're intimidated then I would recommend using Tumblr, which is very easy to use, stylish, and has a huge community of bloggers. Tumblr blogs tend toward shorter and quicker reads, photos, quotes, etc., and Tumblr in general encourages "reblogging" posts from other Tumblr blogs on your own. If you write more frequently or plan to blog more ambitiously in or after this course, you might want to select a platform that gives you more options and control over your content. Wordpress is perhaps the most popular and powerful platform, although it can be a little confusing and the free version puts ads on your posts. Typepad and Blogger are both perfectly good and commonly used competitors. You might also explore newer blogging platforms which seem to emphasize superior style and community engagement, such as Medium and Svbte. Really up to you.

What to do:
    - Sign up with any major blogging platform
    - Call it anything you want, just use your real name as the author name or if you wish to remain anonymous use a pseudonym and email me privately to tell me what it is!

#### 3. A twitter account
Pretty straightforward. Just sign up at twitter.com. The shorter the username, the better. First because you want people to remember it, but more importantly because each character takes up precious space inside tweets. You'll see.

What to do:
    - Just sign up for an account
    - Follow at least 100 other twitter users. Here's how. Do a Google search for "best twitter accounts for" and then some subject area you're interested in and may want to research for your work in this course. So, examples would be: "best twitter accounts for middle east politics" or "best twitter accounts for analyzing media" or whatever. Look for lists of important tweeps (twitter people) already curated for you. Do this for a few different subject areas and just follow everyone you find. Avoid big news organizations like Financial Times or NBC or other such large corporate names (they're typically boring and late on most things). Individual journalists for these big names are often very good though. Ideally you really want to find individuals around the world and "on the ground" in interesting places who are experts on something or are just interesting folks working on interesting projects. These are the kinds of connections that make Twitter extremely interesting and powerful!

#### 4. A twitter client
A twitter "client" is just a third-party application for managing and reading twitter feeds. Twitter itself is just a big huge worldwide "firehose" of millions of tweets per minute. A "client" refers to a special application that helps you manage this craziness. I recommend Tweetdeck, but there are a few other popular ones such as Tweetbot and Hootsuite. Feel free to play around with any of them, the key requirement is that it let you make multiple twitter feeds and organize them in one place.

What to do:
    - Sign up for a twitter client and either download-install-open or log into the web version of your twitter client.
    - When you log into it, notice that the basic layout concept is the "column." Since Twitter is a huge "stream," twitter clients allow you to break that huge stream into several mini-streams which you can organize according to your interests, tastes, and needs.
    - Look for an option to add a new column. In TweetDeck, this is easy and very nice (just look to the left-hand column and click "+ Add Column"). Add one column for "notifications" (aka "mentions" or "replies"). One column for "direct messages." And then add a column for a certain search term, and enter as the search term some keyword associated with your interests. If you're interested in what's going on with the Boycott-Divest-Sanction campaign being waged against the state of Israel, you might make add a new column for the search term "#BDS." The "#" in #BDS makes it a "hashtag", which is just a way for many tweeps to link their tweets to one semi-organized common thread easily searched by others.
    - Do this for at least 3 hashtags or search terms related to your fields of interest.
    - Notice that your twitter client is now a one-stop-shop for the most up-to-date information in the world regarding anything you're interested in.

**4. An RSS reader.** "RSS" stands for "Rich Site Summary" or "Really Simple Syndication", and it's just a simple protocol that turns websites into "feeds" so that readers can subscribe and recieve updates from all of their favorite websites all in one place. That one place is an RSS reader, which is basically just a big self-designed newspaper composed of all the websites you want to follow. Again, there are a few good ones out there, but I recommend Feedly.

What to do:
    - Sign up and either download-install-open or log into the web version of your RSS reader.
    - Find and add at least 20 independent blogs related to your research interests. Use a similar strategy of Googling "best blogs on..." Feel free to add a few traditional news sources if you want, but avoid news sources you already encounter daily in your newspaper/television/radio reports. Most RSS readers, including Feedly, are as simple as using their search box to search for the name of a blog you like and they will automatically locate the RSS feed of that blog. You don't even need to know how that works on the back-end!
    - Notice that your RSS reader is now a one-stop-shop for all of the most interesting independent bloggers who are thinking and writing at the cutting edge of what you're interested in.
    
#### 5. Tie everything together into one nice workspace (Google Chrome)

One reason I recommend Google Chrome is because the aforementioned web services all have nice web apps designed to run inside Google Chrome. They are relatively light and quick, and they are quite cleverly integrated to make Chrome a very powerful dashboard for receiving and contributing to all these online conversations you're now entering.

What to do:
    - Open up a new tab in Chrome, and in the top left you'll see a little button that says "Apps." Click it, and then select the little shopping bag that says "Chrome," but don't worry because everything we're going to buy is free.
    - In the Chrome store, search for "TweetDeck." Install it. This is very quick and easy, everything is self-contained in Chrome.
    - In the Chrome store, search for "Feedly." Install it.
    - Now open a new tab in Chrome, again click "Apps" in the top left. Now on your "Apps" page you should have a TweetDeck app and a Feedly app. When you click them, each one will open in their own tab. These are basically just web pages but optimized to look and work especially well inside of Chrome.
    - Try a search for your blogging platform. They might have a nice app for Chrome too. I don't believe Tumblr does. Either way, go ahead and also open up your blog dashboard (either the app or the web page where you can post to your blog) in a new tab.
    - Now, to wrap everything up. Right click each tab and select "pin tab." This will make it a tiny little tab all the way to the left, immediately available in the background but also out of your way. If you have an older computer, all these pinned tabs may make your computer run slow. If that bothers you, instead just make bookmarks of these tabs in the "Bookmarks" menu in the file bar at the top of Chrome. That way you can quickly enter into any one of these quickly and easily but they won't have to run in the background.

That's all for set-up! Congratulations. If you're new to all these things, you just overhauled your media diet like a fast-food junky switching to raw-food veganism overnight. You just exponentially *increased* your information/knowledge intake, you filtered out a great deal of dubious corporate messaging and connected directly to a few arenas of individuals actually doing work you're interested in, and your microphone is now officially plugged into these arenas. Not to mention, you're all rigged up to do these things easily and painlessly as part of your daily intellectual life. It is truly an extraordinary time to be an intellectual.

## Why? A final note for the still skeptical

A basic fact is that if you don't have a blog and a twitter account, then you basically don't have any way to express yourself or communicate to the world. Think about that. You can wait until you graduate and hopefully obtain a presitigious position as a teacher or a lawyer or a diplomat, but *why wait?* On the internet, you don't have to wait for anything or anyone to simply become whoever you are, to find your people, to talk with whoever you want, and to do the work you want to do in the future *starting right now*. 

In any event, if you don't have at least a blog and a twitter account, then no matter how brilliant your university work is, *it might never actually exist in the world.* Without a web presence, you're only a silent passive listener who writes papers into the abyss of university filing cabinets. If you take this practicum seriously, everything you do for this course and others you can *also* do for the world for any range of purposes you're passionate about: to enter a profession, make friends, to jostle for your own magazine column, to join a movement, bear witness to atrocities, pick fights with politicians, write poems, or perhaps just to be heard.

If you don't have a twitter client and an RSS reader, and everything you know about the world is from Facebook and television, that really is the information equivalent of eating candy bars every meal of the day. The "information superhighway" does not automatically increase one's information and knowledge flows; on the contrary, the standard, naive internet life of most people probably decreases and deforms their daily flow of information and knowledge relative to pre-internet social learning. (Google and Facebook are driven by algorithms which only give you what you already know and like, and which make sure that your voice is only shared with others who already know and like you, probably limiting and *perverting* more than enhancing one's flows of information and communication.) If you're truly here to gain an education and enter the world as an independent and responsible adult human being, then a blog, twitter account, twitter client, and RSS reader are only baseline pre-requisites for even having a chance at becoming who you are in world where the most powerful individuals and institutions couldn't care less about what you become.

The world wide web is the only open public sphere we have left under global capitalism. The only place in the world where you can be whatever you want and say whatever you want without asking for permission, and actually be heard by anyone who is interested. We can't wait for you to join us!

### How we're going to use these things for the course

In short, the percentage of your grade associated with the online component will be assessed by an end-of-term review of your web output through the semester. The more actively you participate and contribute via your blogging and tweeting, the higher your grade will be. Here's a nice catch, though: we will not be judging the "quality" of your web output. This is to make you feel relaxed and encouraged to experiment; say and do whatever you're interested in regarding the issues and questions relevant to the course. Of course, as an adult human being you are responsible for whatever you say or do online, but your grade will only reflect *how much* you have shared your intellectual journey this semester with the world. The only exception is in your specific and direct interactions with classmates (commenting on other students' blogs, replying to other students tweets). In your direct interactions with other students you are expected to give the highest degree of respect and generosity precisely because this is a collective intellectual journey in which you are all allies. The lecturer(s) *will* judge the degree to which you were comradely with your classmates and factor this into your overall assessment. (Notice I don't say you have to be generous to the lecturer(s)! The whole point is to show you that the internet is a place of free learning, free expression, and mutual empowerment through organic affinities; so if you want to say a lecture was bad or my haircut was a disaster or you want to rally the other students to have me fired, you can do that and it won't be judged in your assessment!)

**1. We'll all tweet on a class hashtag (to be announced).** Tweet any course-specific information or questions and include this hashtag. Make a column in your twitter client dedicated to all tweets using this hashtag, so you can easily see anyone else tweeting about the course. Respond and engage to others as constructively as possible. Tweet anything you come across that other students in the course might find interesting or valuable. If you have short questions about the course, tweet them using the class hashtag and you'll receive an answer from the lecturer(s) or a student who might know. The lecturer(s) will also tweet relevant course information but don't worry, it will only be in addition to the other, direct and regular communications with you.

**2. We will all blog about the development of our research projects.** The advances, as well as the trials and tribulations. Think of it as a lab notebook. Interpret that creatively, don't worry (remember you won't be judged for *what* your logging in this lab notebook, only the degree to which you really commit to doing it.) We will all read and, when the spirit moves us, respond to each others' blogs. The lecturer(s) will make a master list of all students' individual blogs and we will all keep each other's blogs in our RSS readers so it will be very quick and easy to regularly check in on each others progress.

**3. If you think you can neglect the online/communicative aspect of this course and you'll just accept the hit to your grade, you're wrong. Here's why: Even your specific formal assessments will be submitted to us via your blogs and twitter, and it's the only way we'll accept them.** In other words, regardless of how much this practicum is "worth" to your final grade, it's a baseline requirement to even submit your main course submissions. This means that setting yourself up according to this practicum is an absolute requirement, even though your overall web output throughout the course will only be assessed as much as the syllabus states.
     Specifically:
        - Each individual will post to their individual blog their individual assignments, and tweet out the blog post. You are totally encouraged to tweet your work at (@) whoever around the web you think might be interested. Just make sure at least one tweet to your blog post goes on the class hashtage!
        - If there's group work, only one individual needs to post the group work to their blog (although you're all welcome to) but then everyone in the group needs to tweet out the link to that blog post. And again, you are highly encouraged to tweet at (@) whoever might be interested in your work.
