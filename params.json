Students are introduced to canonical as well as marginal and emerging perspectives on media politics and asked to weigh them against the empirical record established by extant qualitative and quantitative scholarship. You'll quickly notice that the course materials are in a wide variety of media. All of the materials are digital and freely available to you through links within this document.\r\n\r\nEach week will be devoted to a theme. Typically, each week’s materials have been curated to expose the student to the dominant theoretical perspective, a dissident or heterodox perspective, and something empirical (qualitative or quantitative) to help fix ideas. The balance of these materials will be variable and depend on the nature of theme.\r\n\r\n#### Summary of teaching and learning strategies\r\n\r\nFocused, directed readings which students complete before each session will provide the core material around which each session is organized. Each session will include a lecture providing a general overview of the main points which will be followed by discussion questions in response to which students will exercise their command of the material. These teaching and learning methods will achieve the aims and learning outcomes of the module by providing a focused, consistent, and supportive environment where students engage with the material in multiple ways (through reading, audible/visual lectures, and through their own speaking). \r\n\r\n#### Aims and objectives\r\n\r\n- Students will gain an independent and critical command of the essential questions in media politics. They will learn to engage with historical texts, theoretical texts, contemporary academic research, as well as cutting-edge contemporary discussions of media politics on the internet. In other words, students will acquire the theoretical tools required of any global citizen who would seek to produce new knowledge in the state-of-the-art of media politics.\r\n\r\n- Students will be able to apply their knowledge to diverse real-world issues, questions, and historical trends. - Students will improve their ability to develop original research questions and write formal academic research papers.\r\n\r\n- Students will develop the oral and verbal skills necessary to communicate their ideas effectively to a wide range of audiences. In particular, through their engagement with contemporary theorists and practitioners of media politics online, students will learn the skills and norms required to become active and networked participants in both theoretical discussions and on-the-ground developments in media politics.\r\n\r\n#### What students will gain from this module\r\n\r\nHaving successfully completed the module, students will:\r\n\r\n- Have a considered, critical, independent perspective on the role of media in the politics across contemporary states.\r\n\r\n- Be able to speak, write, and disseminate online their independent perspectives on the main questions and issues in the politics of media.\r\n\r\n- Have a basic working knowledge of today’s incipient trends and questions in the politics of media, and their institutional landscape.\r\n\r\n- Have a more reflexive awareness of how the politics of media shape their own perceptions and behaviors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n#### Part I: Historical context of media scholarship in the social sciences\r\n\r\n##### Week 1.
