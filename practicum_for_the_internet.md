### You're not surfing the net, you're drowning in it! A practicum for young intellectuals in the internet era


### Summary

The world wide web is celebrated for revolutionizing flows of information and communication, but the power of the web is only enjoyed by those who know how to use it. Thus, part of this course is about giving you the resources and tools required for you to flourish on the web as free, creative and politically effective young intellectuals. This document outlines this dimension of the course and explains in detail the tools and practices you'll need to use for this course. Nothing here costs money and nothing requires fancy computer skills. Additionally, see below for explanations and advice which should make everything as accessible as possible.

**In short, the basic toolkit you need to setup is: a personal blog, a twitter account, a twitter client, and an RSS reader.** If you don't know what these things are, don't worry! They're all easy to learn and use, and will make your life *easier* and *more powerful* after just a little bit of investment up front. A blog and a twitter account are quickly becoming absolute requirements for anyone who still wishes to have a voice in society; a twitter client and an RSS reader are indispensible for actually learning from the web.

The course itself will be run with these tools. It's simple: Everything you do toward your research for this course, just do it on your blog and your twitter account. Using our twitter clients and RSS feeds, we'll also be following along with everyone else's progress, and you'll be asked to give each other support and feedback in blog comments and twitter replies. As we go, your progress will be tracked and assessed, and at the end your entire web output will be assessed alongside the more specific assessments of the course.

### A note on anonymity

While you are invited and encouraged to submit everything via your blog, including your longer and more formal assignments, you are also welcome to keep your web presence anonymous if you prefer. Just make your blog and twitter username something unconnected to your real identity (but send me a private email so I know it's you). Anonymous bloggers and tweeters also have an illustrious history! Finally, the course will rely on a back-end system which collects and organizes your content to allow for anonymous grading.

## Details:

**1. A blog.** A blog, short for "weblog," is a simple web site where you post whatever you want and everything is kept organized for you chronologically. There are several free blogging "platforms" which basically do everything for you. For this course, any major blogging platform will do, including any blog you might already run. If you've never blogged and you're intimidated then I would recommend using Tumblr, which is very easy to use, stylish, and has a huge community of bloggers. Tumblr blogs tend toward shorter and quicker reads, photos, quotes, etc., and Tumblr in general encourages "reblogging" posts from other Tumblr blogs on your own. If you write more frequently or plan to blog more ambitiously in or after this course, you might want to select a platform that gives you more options and control over your content. Wordpress is perhaps the most popular and powerful platform, although it can be a little confusing and the free version puts ads on your posts. Typepad and Blogger are both perfectly good and commonly used competitors. You might also explore newer blogging platforms which seem to emphasize superior style and community engagement, such as Medium and Svbte. Really up to you.

Requirements:
    - Sign up with any major blogging platform
    - Call it anything you want, just use your real name as the author name or if you wish to remain anonymous use a pseudonym and email me privately to tell me what it is!

**2. A twitter account**. Pretty straightforward. Just sign up at twitter.com. The shorter the username, the better. First because you want people to remember it, but more importantly because each character takes up precious space when people want to tweet at you!

**3. A twitter client.** A twitter "client" is just a third-party application for managing and reading twitter feeds. Twitter itself is just a big huge worldwide "firehose" of millions of tweets per minute. A "client" refers to a special application that helps you manage this craziness. I recommend Tweetdeck, but there are a few other popular ones such as Tweetbot and Hootsuite. Feel free to play around with any of them, the key requirement is that it let you make multiple twitter feeds and organize them in one place.

**4. An RSS reader.** "RSS" stands for "Rich Site Summary" or "Really Simple Syndication", and it's just a simple protocol that turns websites into "feeds" so that readers can subscribe and recieve updates from all of their favorite websites all in one place. That one place is an RSS reader, which is basically just a big self-designed newspaper composed of all the websites you want to follow. Again, there are a few good ones out there, but I recommend Feedly.

## Why?

If you don't have a blog and a twitter account, then you basically don't have any way to express yourself or communicate to the world. You can wait until you graduate and hopefully obtain a presitigious position as a teacher or a lawyer or a diplomat, but *why wait?* On the internet, you don't have to wait for anything or anyone to simply become whoever you are, to find your people, to talk with whoever you want, and to do the work you want to do in the future *starting right now*. 

In any event, if you don't have at least a blog and a twitter account, then no matter how brilliant your university work is, you still don't exist! Without a web presence, you're only a silent passive listener who writes papers into the abyss of university filing cabinets. No more!

If you don't have a twitter client and an RSS reader, then you can't control your own media diet and you won't be surfing the net so much as it's surfing you. The "information superhighway" does not automatically increase one's information and knowledge flows; on the contrary, the standard, naive internet life of most people probably decreases and deforms their daily flow of information and knowledge relative to pre-internet social learning. (Google and Facebook are driven by algorithms which only give you what you already know and like, and which make sure that your voice is only shared with others who already know and like you, probably limiting and *perverting* more than enhancing one's flows of information and communication.) Ergo, because you are here to learn about the politics of the media, a blog, twitter account, twitter client, and RSS reader are implicit pre-requisites for even having a chance at learning something about the politics of the media today.
